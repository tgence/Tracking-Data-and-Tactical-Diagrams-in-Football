    This work introduced an interactive tactical analysis tool for football that merges the robustness of professional tracking data processing with the creativity of dynamic visualization and annotation. The design integrates essential, intuitively usable features, such as smooth navigation, precise event synchronization, and adaptable overlays, with more innovative concepts, including perceptually optimized themes and real-time pressure visualization inspired by advanced sports analytics research.  
    
    The goal throughout has been to combine reliability, clarity, and efficiency, while leaving space for exploratory and creative tactical experimentation. By grounding the interaction model in established usability principles: consistency, feedback, and minimal cognitive load—the prototype ensures that advanced analytical capabilities remain accessible even under real-time constraints.  
    
    Beyond its current implementation, the system offers a strong foundation for the integration of more ambitious functionalities, such as predictive passing feasibility, multi-view comparison modes, and composition planning. As such, it not only delivers a practically usable prototype, but also points toward future directions for football analysis tools that are both analytically rigorous and intuitively engaging.
