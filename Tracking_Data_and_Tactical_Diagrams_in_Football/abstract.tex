Tactics boards are widely used in football to visualize, communicate, and develop strategic ideas, from professional clubs to grassroots teams. While digital tools have become more common, existing solutions often lack both intuitive interaction and support for domain-specific features that reflect the complexity of football tactics. This thesis addresses these gaps by developing a concrete, functional prototype of a digital tactical diagram tool focused on multi-touch interaction. The design and implementation are grounded in both practical workflow needs and established visualization principles. The work identifies which critical features remain underdeveloped in current software, demonstrates what can be achieved with a user-centered design approach, and offers guidelines for future improvements in digital tactics platforms.
